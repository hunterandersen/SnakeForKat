<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
<p align="left" >
A snake game I made and hosted for my girlfriend to play. She's one of the few people in the world still playing Neopets and one of their games is essentiallly just snake. She's gotten quite good at it, but their version doesn't increase the speed over time, so this provied a nice return to what I understand as the classic version of a snake game. I have it hosted so that she can play it whenever she wants. This was a very fun project to make and it was nice to have someone with genuine interest in what I was making.

<!-- ROADMAP -->
## Roadmap

I don't inted to continue working on this project much, beyond tinkering with simple color design. I'm not happy with the current color scheme.

- [] Update the color scheme (background webpage/background of game canvas/player color)
- [] Move the index.html/css/js files out of the root folder without breaking the hosting via Netlify
- [] Update the graphics by adding images instead of drawing everything
- [] Add a database backend to allow for persistent high scores
- [] Add sound effects to enhance game experience
